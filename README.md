Deagles AV is a modern Android malware analysis framework that combines static inspection, cloud-based intelligence, and AI-driven threat synthesis to bridge traditional signature-based detection with behavioral analysis.  
Future updates will focus on improving response quality, increasing detection accuracy, and enhancing partial offline analysis capabilities to ensure more reliable operation with reduced cloud dependency.

## 🧠 System Overview

Deagles AV analyzes Android applications using a hybrid security pipeline that integrates static analysis, cloud-based behavioral intelligence, and AI-powered verdict synthesis.
Planned improvements include refined heuristic scoring, faster response times, higher detection precision, and stronger offline static analysis for environments with limited connectivity.


## 🚀 Analysis Workflow

**Deconstruction**  
Extracts `AndroidManifest.xml` and DEX headers from the APK.

**Integrity Check**  
Generates a unique SHA-256 fingerprint and checks global malware databases.

**Static Audit**  
- Shaparak phishing and payment-gateway detection  
- DEX entropy analysis for packed or obfuscated code  

**Behavioral Query**  
Submits encrypted samples to VirusTotal sandbox environments.

**AI Synthesis**  
Gemini AI correlates all findings into a final **Threat Score** and technical summary.
